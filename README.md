# Mika Yli-Pentti

Hi! My name is Mika and I'm passionate about all aspects of 3D graphics and deeply enjoy programming games!
<br>

- Iâ€™m currently studying at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/), looking to broaden my skill set to software development and graphics programming.

- Proficient in C#, Unity, and various 3D digital content creation software.

- Actively deepening my expertise in C/C++, Unreal Engine, and HLSL.

- Planning to explore DirectX and learn Houdini in the future.
  
<br>

My expertise extends across multiple facets of game production, ensuring that art and code work seamlessly together to create a visually stunning and immersive gaming experience.

With my background in game development, I can help bring your creative vision to life and contribute to its success.
