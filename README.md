## Hi 👋
My name is Mika and I am excited about everything related to 3D art and greatly enjoy programming games!

💎 Proficient in C#, Unity, and various 3D digital content creation software.

📌 Actively deepening my expertise in C/C++, Unreal Engine, and HLSL.

🧩 Planning to explore DirectX and learn Houdini in the future.
